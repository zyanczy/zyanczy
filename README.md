## Hi there! Welcome to Ziyan's GitHub.

I'm a Psychology and Cognitive Studies double major, with a minor in Computer Science. I’m passionate about **human-centered design**, and I love building projects that create real social impact.

## About Me

When I'm not coding or digging into data, you’ll probably find me diving into web design tutorials, active on Reddit, or experimenting with something new in the kitchen.  

I’m a big fan of cozy corners and quiet moments to just chill and reflect — preferably with a warm cup of something and some lo-fi in the background.

Currently, I’m focusing on growing my technical skills in machine learning, data storytelling, and thoughtful UI/UX. Always open to exciting projects and new collabs!
