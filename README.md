Hi there! Welcome to Ziyan's GitHub.🌿

Psychology + Cognitive Studies @ Vanderbilt · ML/AI + Human-Centered Design

I’m passionate about building data-driven, human-centered projects that create real social impact. My work blends machine learning, cognitive science, and thoughtful UI/UX design — all with a focus on accessibility, storytelling, and improving people’s lives.

I love projects that sit at the intersection of the mind and technology: predicting behavior, understanding patterns, and designing tools that help people learn, adapt, and thrive.


## 📁 Highlighted ML/AI & Data Science Projects

## 🌱 About Me

Outside ML and design, you’ll find me: diving into web design tutorials, active on Reddit, or experimenting with something new in the kitchen.  

I’m a big fan of cozy corners and quiet moments to just chill and reflect — preferably with a warm cup of something and some lo-fi in the background.

Currently, I’m focusing on growing my technical skills in machine learning, data storytelling, and thoughtful UI/UX. Always open to exciting projects and new collabs!
