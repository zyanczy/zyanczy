## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**zyanczy/zyanczy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


#I'm a Psychology and Cognitive Studies double major, with a minor in Computer Science. Iâ€™m passionate about **human-centered design**, and I love building projects that create real social impact.  


When I'm not coding or digging into data, youâ€™ll probably find me diving into web design tutorials, active on Reddit, or experimenting with something new in the kitchen.  

Iâ€™m a big fan of cozy corners and quiet moments to just chill and reflect â€” preferably with a warm cup of something and some lo-fi in the background.

Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on growing my technical skills in machine learning, data storytelling, and thoughtful UI/UX. Always open to exciting projects and new collabs!
